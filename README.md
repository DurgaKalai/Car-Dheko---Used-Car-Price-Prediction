# Car-Dheko---Used-Car-Price-Prediction
# Domain:
### Automotive Industry , Data Science, Machine Learning
# Project Scope:
### The project involves historical used car price data from CarDekho, including features like make, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and city. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts car prices based on these attributes and integrate it into a Streamlit web app, allowing users to input car details and receive instant price estimates.

# Skills Gained from This Project:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handling missing data, outliers, and feature encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing data patterns and correlations.
Machine Learning Model Development

Building and training regression models.
Price Prediction Techniques

Applying regression algorithms for price estimation.
Model Evaluation and Optimization

Evaluating model performance and tuning hyperparameters.
Model Deployment

Deploying models for real-time predictions.
Streamlit Application Development

Creating interactive web apps to input data and display results.
Documentation and Reporting

Documenting the process and presenting results.
